TestExecuter
============

This plugin allows you to choose specific tests you want to run.
First, you need to specify the name of the environment variable in which you want your selected tests to be saved in (after build the selected tests will be in this environment variable as a JSON array).
Second, you need to enter the properties file fath. This file will contain all your tests and maybe some extra fields for the plugin (more details about the properties file are in the appropriate help field).
After that, your tests will be shown in a tree diagram, allowing you to select some of them.

The plugin consists of the following files:
==================================================================
* src/main/java/il/ac/technion/jenkins/plugins
	- TestExecuter.java: TestExecuter class
* /src/main/resources/il/ac/technion/jenkins/plugins/TestExecuter
	- config.jelly: UI for job configuration for TestExecuter class
	- index.jelly: UI for job build for TestExecuter class
	- help files for the configuration UI (html)
* /src/main/webapp/js
	- TestExecuter.js: Javascript function for the configuration and build UI

TestExecuter.java
==================================================================
Since our plugin is a build parameter our TestExecuter class extends "SimpleParameterDefinition" class.

Members:
-
* **uuid** - A random number which helps to give a unique id's to the objects used in the jelly files.
	We need it since we want to be able to add the plugin to the job as many times as we want.
	That way our objects are unique in each addition and we can defer them from one another.
	Furthermore, if the plugin are added more then once, the on build you will get more then one tree.
	That way we can also defer the trees from one another.
* **propertiesFilePath** - In this parameter we will save the properties file path the user entered.
* **enableField** - Name of the field that will imply if the test is enabled or not. 
* **groupBy** - Name of the field in which the plugin will group the tests by. 
* **showFields** - Name of the field(s) that will be shown in the tests tree. 
* **multiplicityField** - Name of the field, in which the plugin will save in the amount of times the test should run. 
* **fieldSeparator** - The character that will separate between the fields in the tests tree. 

Significant functions:
-
* getAsJson() - Returns a json object which consists of (field/content) pairs.   
	Only for the following fields: enableField, groupBy, fieldSeparator, showFields, multiplicityField.
* loadPropertiesFile(String) - Calls similar function in the DescriptorImpl class.
	Will be explained later.

Nested classes:
-
* **ReadFileResponse:** This class is the return value of loadPropertiesFile().
	It consists of the members: success, errorMsg, content.
	It help us manage the success/failure of the properties file opening.
* **DescriptorImpl:** This class is used to describe the TestExecuter class.
	- loadPropertiesFile(String) - This function gets the file path and tries to open it.
			If it succeeds then it returns the content of the file.
			If it fails then it returns appropriate message with the reason of the failure and a null for the content.
			This function can be called by javascript code.

config.jelly
==================================================================
This file creates the plugin UI that appears in the job configuration.

It contains:
-
- Javascript object named **TestExecuterRPC** that will contain an object that will allow us to call RPC method
	in the TestExecurer/DescriptorImpl class. Namely, loadPropertiesFile() RPC function.
- Textbox for the **environment variable** in which the selected tests will be saved in.
- Textbox for the **properties file path**.
- Textbox for the **description** (the user can enter a description if he wants).

- **Override section:**
	In this section the user can override the properties he defined in the properties file or define them for the first time.   
	This section contains of the following:
	* **"Fetch properties From File" button** - Call loadSettingsFromPropertiesFile function (javascript).
		This function retrieves all the properties that exist in the properties file and fill the appropriate fields with them.
	* **"Show/Hide Available Fields" button** - Call showHideAvailableFields function (javascript).
		This function will show/hide all the fields used in the tests the user defined in the properties file.
	* There are five optional blocks, one for each property.
		By clicking on each checkbox a textbox will appear. In this textbox the property content will be entered.
		To override a property the checkbox must be checked.

index.jelly
==================================================================
This file creates the plugin UI that appears after clicking on "build".

It contains:
-
- **CSS section** - Defines how the tree of tests will look.
- **"Select All" button** - Call selectGroupInDiv function (javascript).
	We call this function with a "true" value since we want all the tests to be selected.
	This function marks all nodes in the tree, and adds all of them to the selectedTests variable.
- **"Unselect All" button** - Call selectGroupInDiv function (javascript).
	We call this function with a "false" value since we want all the tests to not be selected.
	This function unmarks all nodes in the tree, and delete all of them from the selectedTests variable.
- **TestTreeContainer** - This div is initialized empty and will be filled by "loadTreeFromFile" function (javascript).
	
- Javascript object named **TestExecuterRPC** that will contain an object that will allow us to call RPC method
	in the TestExecurer class. Namely, loadPropertiesFile() RPC function.
- Call to the "loadTreeFromFile" function (javascript), which opens the file containing the tests and builds the tree.

To pass the selected tests to our TestExecuter class, we need to define a container named "parameters"
with a input field named "name" containing the name of the parameter.
For this we defined the following hidden input fields nested under a span name parameters:
- **name** - The name of the environment variable.
- **selectedTests** - A JSON array (as string) of the selected tests.

TestExecuter.js
==================================================================
This file includes all the functionality of both the configuration and the build UI.

API functions:
-
* loadTreeFromFile(filePath, selectedTestsTextBoxName, testsTreeContainerName, fields)
```
	Load all tests from file. Build the tests tree and groups the tests. The          
	tests tree will be appended to testsTreeContainer. When tests are selected,       
	they will be written to selectedTestsTextBox. The parameters for building the     
	tree defined in the properties file and fields.
	The tree UI consists of:		
	- group checkbox - by clicking on this checkbox all the sub group will be
		selected/unselected and will be added to the selectedTests variable. 
	- test checbox - by clicking on this checkbox, the test will be added to the
		selectedTests variable.
		If by clicking on this checkbox all the group is marked, then the group
		checkbox will be marked as well.
		If by clicking on this checkbox all the group is not marked, then the group
		checkbox will not be marked as well.
	- multiplicity textbox - by entering a number the number will be added to the
		appropriate test in the multiplicityField.
		If the value was not a number the textbox will be colored in red.
		If the value was 0 or not a number, then the number that will be saved will
		be 1.
